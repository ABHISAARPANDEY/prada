# Vertical Analysis Section - Layman's Guide

## What is This Section?

Vertical Analysis (also called Common-Size Analysis) shows each financial item as a percentage of a base figure. Instead of comparing absolute numbers across years, it shows the "composition" or "structure" of financial statements. Think of it like a pie chart - it shows what percentage each piece represents of the whole.

## What Information Does It Show?

### Income Statement Vertical Analysis
Each item shown as **% of Net Revenues**:
- Net Revenues: 100% (the base)
- Cost of Goods Sold: X% of revenue
- Gross Margin: X% of revenue
- Operating Expenses: X% of revenue
- EBIT: X% of revenue
- Net Income: X% of revenue

### Balance Sheet Vertical Analysis
Each item shown as **% of Total Assets**:
- Total Assets: 100% (the base)
- Total Equity: X% of assets
- Total Debt: X% of assets

### Trend Indicators
- **Increasing** (↑): Percentage is going up
- **Decreasing** (↓): Percentage is going down
- **Stable** (—): Percentage stays the same

## Why Is This Important?

Vertical Analysis helps you:
- **See Structure**: What percentage of revenue goes to costs vs. profit?
- **Compare Efficiency**: Is the company becoming more efficient over time?
- **Identify Changes**: Has the cost structure changed?
- **Benchmark**: Compare to industry standards
- **Understand Margins**: See profitability as percentages

## Common Questions You Might Be Asked

1. **"What is Vertical Analysis?"**
   - It shows each financial item as a percentage of a base figure. For income statements, everything is % of revenue. For balance sheets, everything is % of total assets.

2. **"Why use percentages instead of actual numbers?"**
   - Percentages make it easy to compare the "structure" or "composition" regardless of company size. A 20% profit margin means the same thing whether revenue is €1B or €10B.

3. **"What does 'COGS is 19.7% of revenue' mean?"**
   - It means for every €100 PRADA makes in sales, €19.70 goes to the cost of making/buying the products. The lower this percentage, the better (more profit margin).

4. **"What does 'EBIT is 22.5% of revenue' mean?"**
   - It means for every €100 in sales, PRADA makes €22.50 in operating profit. This is the EBIT margin - a key profitability metric.

5. **"Why is Net Revenues always 100%?"**
   - Because it's the base figure. Everything else is compared to it. If revenue is the "whole pie," other items show what percentage of that pie they represent.

6. **"What does an 'increasing' trend mean?"**
   - It depends on the item! For profit items (EBIT, Net Income), increasing is good. For cost items (COGS, Expenses), decreasing is good.

7. **"How do I know if a change is good or bad?"**
   - **Good**: Profit percentages increasing, cost percentages decreasing
   - **Bad**: Profit percentages decreasing, cost percentages increasing
   - PRADA shows all good trends!

8. **"What's the difference between Horizontal and Vertical Analysis?"**
   - **Horizontal**: Compares the same item across years (growth over time)
   - **Vertical**: Shows each item as % of base (structure/composition)

## Real-World Analogy

Think of Vertical Analysis like a budget breakdown:
- **Your Income**: €5,000/month (100%)
- **Rent**: €1,500 (30% of income)
- **Food**: €500 (10% of income)
- **Savings**: €1,000 (20% of income)

This shows the "structure" of your finances. For PRADA, it shows the structure of their financial statements!

## Key Takeaways

- COGS decreased from 24.3% to 19.7% of revenue (more efficient)
- Gross Margin increased from 75.7% to 80.4% (more profitable per sale)
- EBIT Margin increased from 14.5% to 22.5% (much more profitable)
- Net Income Margin increased from 8.8% to 14.2% (keeping more profit)
- All profit margins improving = excellent performance

## How to Use This Information

When presenting:
1. Explain that percentages show "structure" or "composition"
2. Show how profit margins improved (good sign)
3. Show how cost percentages decreased (efficiency)
4. Use the trend indicators to highlight improvements
5. Compare percentages across years to show progress

## What the Table Shows

The vertical analysis table reveals:
- **Cost Structure**: What % of revenue goes to costs
- **Profitability Structure**: What % of revenue becomes profit
- **Efficiency Trends**: Are costs decreasing as % of revenue?
- **Margin Improvements**: Are profit margins increasing?

## Important Concepts Explained Simply

### Common-Size Income Statement
- **Base**: Net Revenues = 100%
- **Everything else**: Shown as % of revenue
- **Purpose**: See what portion of each sale goes to costs vs. profit
- **PRADA's Story**: More of each sale is becoming profit!

### Common-Size Balance Sheet
- **Base**: Total Assets = 100%
- **Everything else**: Shown as % of assets
- **Purpose**: See the capital structure (how much equity vs. debt)
- **PRADA's Story**: More equity relative to assets = financially stronger

### Margin Analysis
- **Gross Margin %**: Profit from sales as % of revenue
- **EBIT Margin %**: Operating profit as % of revenue
- **Net Margin %**: Final profit as % of revenue
- **PRADA's Trend**: All margins improving = becoming more profitable

## Efficiency Indicators

From Vertical Analysis, you can see PRADA is becoming more efficient:
1. **COGS % decreasing**: Making products more cost-effectively
2. **Operating Expenses % stable/decreasing**: Controlling costs well
3. **Profit Margins increasing**: Keeping more of each sale as profit
4. **All trends positive**: Consistent improvement across all metrics

## Comparison Across Years

**2021 Structure:**
- 24.3% of revenue = COGS
- 75.7% of revenue = Gross Margin
- 14.5% of revenue = EBIT
- 8.8% of revenue = Net Income

**2023 Structure:**
- 19.7% of revenue = COGS (↓ better!)
- 80.4% of revenue = Gross Margin (↑ better!)
- 22.5% of revenue = EBIT (↑ much better!)
- 14.2% of revenue = Net Income (↑ much better!)

Every single metric improved! 🎉
