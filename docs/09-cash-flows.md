# Cash Flows Section - Layman's Guide

## What is This Section?

The Cash Flows section shows the actual money moving in and out of PRADA. Unlike profit (which is an accounting concept), cash flow shows real cash - money you can touch and use. Think of it like your bank account: it shows money coming in and going out, not just "profit" on paper.

## What Information Does It Show?

### Three Types of Cash Flow

1. **Operating Cash Flow**: Money from running the business (selling products)
   - Positive = making money from operations ✅
   - This is the most important - it's the core business

2. **Investing Cash Flow**: Money spent on assets (stores, equipment, investments)
   - Usually negative = spending money on growth
   - Examples: Opening new stores, buying equipment

3. **Financing Cash Flow**: Money from loans or paid to investors
   - Can be positive (borrowing) or negative (paying back loans, dividends)
