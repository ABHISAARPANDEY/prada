# Balance Sheet Section - Layman's Guide

## What is This Section?

The Balance Sheet is like a company's "financial snapshot" at a specific point in time. It shows what PRADA owns (assets), what they owe (liabilities/debt), and what belongs to owners (equity). Think of it like your personal net worth statement: assets (house, car, savings) minus debts (mortgage, loans) equals your equity (net worth).

## What Information Does It Show?

### Balance Sheet Cards
Three key metrics for each year:
- **Total Assets**: Everything PRADA owns (stores, inventory, cash, equipment, etc.)
- **Total Equity**: What belongs to shareholders/owners
- **Debt**: What PRADA owes (calculated as Assets - Equity)

### Bar Chart

- Total Assets over 3 years
- Total Equity over 3 years
- Debt over 3 years

## Why Is This Important?

The Balance Sheet tells you:
- **Financial Strength**: How much the company is worth
- **Financial Stability**: How much debt vs. equity (leverage)
- **Growth**: Are assets growing? (More assets = bigger company)
- **Risk Level**: Too much debt = risky, more equity = safer

## Common Questions You Might Be Asked

1. **"What is a Balance Sheet?"**
   - A financial statement showing what a company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and what belongs to owners (equity) at a specific date. The equation: Assets = Equity + Debt

2. **"What are Assets?"**
   - Everything PRADA owns that has value: cash, inventory (handbags, clothes), stores, equipment, investments, etc. Think of it as "what we have."

3. **"What is Equity?"**
   - The value that belongs to shareholders/owners. It's like the "net worth" of the company. If PRADA sold everything and paid all debts, equity is what's left for owners.

4. **"What is Debt?"**
   - Money PRADA borrowed that must be repaid. This includes loans, bonds, and other obligations. Calculated as: Debt = Total Assets - Total Equity

5. **"Why does Assets = Equity + Debt?"**
   - Because everything PRADA owns (assets) was either paid for by owners (equity) or borrowed (debt). It's a fundamental accounting equation.

6. **"Is more debt bad?"**
   - Not necessarily! Some debt is normal and can help a company grow. But too much debt is risky. PRADA has a healthy balance.

7. **"What does it mean if equity is growing?"**
   - Good sign! It means the company is becoming more valuable and less dependent on debt. Owners' stake is increasing.

8. **"How do you read the Balance Sheet?"**
   - Look at the relationship between assets, equity, and debt. More equity relative to debt = financially stronger. Growing assets = company is expanding.

## Real-World Analogy

Think of a Balance Sheet like your personal finances:
- **Assets**: Your house (€500,000), car (€30,000), savings (€50,000) = €580,000 total
- **Debt**: Mortgage (€300,000), car loan (€20,000) = €320,000 total
- **Equity**: Assets - Debt = €260,000 (your net worth)

For PRADA, it's the same concept but with billions!

## Key Takeaways

- PRADA's assets grew from €6.96B to €7.62B (2021-2023)
- Equity increased from €3.13B to €3.88B, showing financial strength
- Debt-to-equity ratio is healthy, meaning PRADA isn't over-leveraged
- Growing assets show the company is expanding

## How to Use This Information

When presenting:
1. Explain the basic equation: Assets = Equity + Debt
2. Show that PRADA's assets are growing (company expanding)
3. Highlight that equity is growing faster than debt (good sign)
4. Use the chart to visualize the balance
5. Explain what "healthy balance" means

## What the Chart Shows

The bar chart visualization:
- **Assets bar**: Total value of everything PRADA owns
- **Equity bar**: Owners' stake (growing = good)
- **Debt bar**: What they owe (stable or decreasing = good)
- **All bars growing**: Company is expanding
- **Equity growing faster than debt**: Financially stronger

## Important Concepts Explained Simply

### Total Assets

- **What it is**: Owners' stake in the company
- **Why it matters**: More equity = less risk, more financial strength
- **PRADA's trend**: Growing = becoming financially stronger

### Debt
- **What it is**: Money borrowed that must be repaid
- **Why it matters**: Too much debt = risky, some debt = normal
- **PRADA's trend**: Stable with growing assets = healthy leverage

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
- **What it is**: Debt divided by equity (shown in Ratios section)
- **Why it matters**: Shows financial risk level
