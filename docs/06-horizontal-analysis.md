## Common Questions You Might Be Asked

1. **"What is Horizontal Analysis?"**
   - It's comparing the same financial item across different years to see how it changed. Like comparing your weight from year to year.

2. **"What does 'Change 2022' mean?"**
   - It's the difference between 2022 and 2021. If revenue was €3.37B in 2021 and €4.20B in 2022, the change is +€835M.

3. **"What does '% Change' mean?"**
   - It's the percentage increase or decrease. If revenue grew from €3.37B to €4.20B, that's a 24.8% increase.

4. **"What is CAGR?"**
   - Compound Annual Growth Rate - the average yearly growth rate over multiple years. If revenue grew 40.4% over 2 years, CAGR is about 18.5% per year.

5. **"Why are some changes positive (green) and some negative (red)?"**
   - **Green/Positive**: Good changes (revenue up, profit up)
   - **Red/Negative**: Bad changes (though sometimes negative is good, like if expenses decrease)

6. **"What does it mean if revenue grows 25% but expenses grow 30%?"**
   - That's concerning! Expenses are growing faster than revenue, meaning the company is becoming less efficient. PRADA's expenses grew slower than revenue = good!

7. **"How do I read the table?"**
   - Look at the item name (left column), then see the values for each year, then check the change columns to see growth/decline.

8. **"What's the most important number in horizontal analysis?"**
   - Revenue growth and profit growth are most important. If both are positive and growing, the company is doing well.

## Real-World Analogy

Think of Horizontal Analysis like tracking your fitness progress:
- **2021**: You can lift 100 lbs
- **2022**: You can lift 120 lbs (20% increase)
- **2023**: You can lift 140 lbs (16.7% increase from 2022)

The horizontal analysis shows your progress over time. For PRADA, it shows financial progress!
