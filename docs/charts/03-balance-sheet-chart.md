## Common Questions You Might Be Asked

1. **"Why do Assets = Equity + Debt?"**
   - Because everything PRADA owns (assets) was either paid for by owners (equity) or borrowed (debt). It's a fundamental accounting equation that always balances.

2. **"What are Assets?"**
   - Everything PRADA owns: cash, inventory (handbags, clothes), stores, equipment, investments, etc. Think "what we have."

3. **"What is Equity?"**
   - The value that belongs to shareholders/owners. If PRADA sold everything and paid all debts, equity is what's left for owners. Think "owners' stake."

4. **"What is Debt?"**
   - Money PRADA borrowed that must be repaid: loans, bonds, etc. Calculated as Assets - Equity.

5. **"Why are Assets bars tallest?"**
   - Because assets include everything - both what owners paid for (equity) and what was borrowed (debt). Assets = the total.

6. **"Is more debt bad?"**
   - Not necessarily! Some debt is normal and can help growth. But too much debt is risky. PRADA has a healthy balance - equity is larger than debt.

7. **"What does it mean if Equity is growing?"**
   - Excellent! It means the company is becoming more valuable and less dependent on debt. Owners' stake is increasing.

8. **"How do I know if the balance is healthy?"**
   - Look at Equity vs Debt:
   - **More equity than debt** = Strong ✅ (PRADA has this)
   - **More debt than equity** = Risky ❌
   - **Equity growing faster** = Getting stronger ✅ (PRADA has this)

9. **"What if Assets bar gets shorter?"**
   - That would be concerning - it means the company is shrinking. But PRADA's assets are growing = expanding ✅

## Real-World Analogy

Think of this chart like your personal finances:
- **Assets**: Your house (€500K) + car (€30K) + savings (€50K) = €580K total
- **Debt**: Mortgage (€300K) + car loan (€20K) = €320K
- **Equity**: Assets - Debt = €260K (your net worth)

For PRADA, it's the same concept but with billions! The chart shows this relationship over 3 years.
