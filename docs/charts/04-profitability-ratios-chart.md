## Common Questions You Might Be Asked

1. **"Why are there three margin lines?"**
   - They show profit at different stages: Gross (after product costs), EBIT (after operating expenses), Net (after everything). Each shows a different level of profitability.

2. **"Why is Gross Margin always highest?"**
   - Because it's the first profit calculation - revenue minus only the cost of goods sold. Other margins subtract more expenses, so they're lower.

3. **"What does 80.4% Gross Margin mean?"**
   - For every €100 PRADA makes in sales, they have €80.40 left after paying for the products. That's excellent for a luxury brand!

4. **"What does 22.5% EBIT Margin mean?"**
   - For every €100 in sales, PRADA makes €22.50 in operating profit (before interest and taxes). This is very strong.

5. **"What does 14.2% Net Margin mean?"**
   - For every €100 in sales, PRADA keeps €14.20 as final profit (after all expenses and taxes). This is strong profitability.

6. **"Why are all lines going up?"**
   - Excellent! It means PRADA is becoming more profitable at every level. They're keeping more of each sale as profit.

7. **"What if a line goes down?"**
   - That would be concerning - it means profitability is declining at that level. But PRADA shows all lines going up ✅

8. **"What's a good margin for luxury fashion?"**
   - **Gross Margin**: 70%+ is excellent (PRADA: 80.4%) ✅
   - **EBIT Margin**: 15%+ is very good (PRADA: 22.5%) ✅
   - **Net Margin**: 10%+ is strong (PRADA: 14.2%) ✅

## Real-World Analogy

Think of margins like a salary breakdown:
- **Gross Margin**: Your salary after basic deductions (like your gross pay)
- **EBIT Margin**: Your take-home after major expenses (like your net pay)
- **Net Margin**: Your actual savings after everything (like what you save)

If all three are increasing, you're becoming more financially efficient! That's PRADA's story.
