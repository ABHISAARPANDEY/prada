## Common Questions You Might Be Asked

1. **"Why are there so many bars?"**
   - Each bar represents a different financial item. Together, they show the complete income statement - from revenue to final profit.

2. **"Why is the Revenue bar always tallest?"**
   - Because revenue is the starting point - total money from sales. Everything else is revenue minus expenses, so other bars are shorter.

3. **"What's the order of bars from top to bottom?"**
   - Revenue (top) → COGS → Gross Margin → Operating Expenses → EBIT → Net Income (bottom)
   - This shows the "profit waterfall"

4. **"What does it mean if bars are getting taller each year?"**
   - Good sign! It means that financial item is increasing. For revenue and profit, taller = better.

5. **"What does the gap between bars mean?"**
   - The gaps show expenses or deductions:
   - **Revenue to COGS gap**: Direct costs
   - **COGS to Gross Margin**: This IS the gross margin
   - **Gross Margin to EBIT gap**: Operating expenses
   - **EBIT to Net Income gap**: Interest, taxes, other expenses

6. **"Why are some bars colored differently?"**
   - Different colors help distinguish between items. Gold often highlights important metrics like EBIT.

7. **"How do I compare 2021 vs 2023?"**
   - Look at the same bar type (e.g., Net Income) in 2021 group vs 2023 group. The 2023 bar should be taller = growth.

8. **"What if a bar gets shorter?"**
   - It depends on which bar:
   - **Revenue shorter** = Bad ❌ (sales declining)
   - **Expenses shorter** = Good ✅ (costs decreasing)
   - **Profit shorter** = Bad ❌ (profit declining)

## Real-World Analogy

❌ **"Shorter bars are bad"**
- Not necessarily! For expenses, shorter is good. For revenue and profit, taller is good.
