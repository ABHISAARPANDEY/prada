## Common Questions You Might Be Asked

1. **"What is Year-over-Year Growth?"**
   - It's the percentage change from one year to the next. If revenue was €4.20B in 2022 and €4.73B in 2023, that's 12.5% growth.

2. **"Why is 2021 at 0%?"**
   - Because 2021 is the first year in our analysis, there's no previous year to compare to. Growth calculations start from 2022.

3. **"What does 24.8% revenue growth mean?"**
   - It means PRADA's sales grew by 24.8% from 2021 to 2022. That's very strong growth - almost 25% more sales!

4. **"Why is Net Income growth higher than Revenue growth?"**
   - Excellent question! This means PRADA is becoming more efficient - they're not just selling more, they're making more profit from each sale. This is a very good sign!

5. **"Is 12.5% growth good?"**
   - Yes! For a mature luxury brand, 12.5% revenue growth is excellent. Most companies would be happy with 5-10% growth.

6. **"Why did growth slow from 2022 to 2023?"**
   - 2022 had exceptional growth (likely post-COVID recovery). 2023 growth is still strong but more normalized. This is actually healthy - unsustainable high growth isn't always good.

7. **"What if a line goes negative?"**
   - That would be very concerning - it means that metric is declining. But PRADA shows all positive growth ✅

8. **"What does the chart tell us about the future?"**
   - Consistent positive growth suggests PRADA is on a good trajectory. However, past performance doesn't guarantee future results, but it's a positive indicator.

9. **"Why are there two lines?"**
   - To compare revenue growth vs. profit growth. If profit is growing faster, that's excellent - it means efficiency is improving. PRADA shows this! ✅

## Real-World Analogy

Think of growth rates like speed:
- **Revenue Growth**: How fast you're driving (speed)
- **Net Income Growth**: How fast you're accelerating (acceleration)

If you're driving fast AND accelerating, you're doing great! That's PRADA's situation. Even better - profit is accelerating faster than revenue, meaning they're becoming more efficient!
