# Leverage and ROE Chart - Layman's Guide

## What is This Chart?

This line chart in the Ratios section shows two important financial health metrics: Debt-to-Equity ratio and Return on Equity (ROE). It's like tracking your debt-to-income ratio and investment returns - but for PRADA's financial structure.

## What Does It Show?

### Two Lines on the Chart:
1. **Debt-to-Equity % (Black Line)**: How much debt vs. equity
2. **Return on Equity % (Gold Line)**: How well they use owners' money

### X-Axis (Horizontal):
- Years: 2021, 2022, 2023

### Y-Axis (Vertical):
- Percentage (varies by metric)

## How to Read This Chart

### Step 1: Understand Each Metric
- **Debt-to-Equity %**: Financial risk level (lower is generally better)

- **Increasing** = Becoming more efficient ✅
- **PRADA's**: Improving over time

## Common Questions You Might Be Asked

1. **"What is Debt-to-Equity Ratio?"**
   - It shows how much debt PRADA has compared to equity. A lower ratio generally means less financial risk. PRADA maintains a healthy balance.

2. **"What is Return on Equity (ROE)?"**
   - It shows how well PRADA uses shareholders' money to generate profit. Higher ROE = better use of capital. Think of it like return on investment for owners.

3. **"Why are these two metrics together?"**
   - They both measure financial health from different angles: Debt-to-Equity shows risk, ROE shows efficiency. Together, they give a complete picture.

4. **"What's a good Debt-to-Equity ratio?"**
   - It depends on the industry, but generally:
   - **Below 100%**: Conservative (PRADA is in this range) ✅
   - **100-200%**: Moderate
   - **Above 200%**: High risk

5. **"What's a good ROE?"**
   - **15%+**: Excellent (PRADA is improving toward this)
   - **10-15%**: Good
   - **Below 10%**: Needs improvement

6. **"Why is Debt-to-Equity important?"**
   - It shows financial risk. Too much debt = risky. Some debt = normal. PRADA has a healthy balance.

7. **"Why is ROE important?"**
   - It shows capital efficiency. If you invest €100, how much profit do you make? Higher ROE = better investment.

8. **"What if Debt-to-Equity goes up?"**
   - It depends on context. If it's still reasonable and assets are growing, it might be okay. But generally, stable or decreasing is better.

9. **"What if ROE goes down?"**
   - That would be concerning - it means they're using capital less efficiently. But PRADA's ROE is improving ✅

## Real-World Analogy

Think of these metrics like personal finance:
- **Debt-to-Equity**: Like your debt-to-income ratio - how much you owe vs. what you own
- **ROE**: Like your investment return - if you invest €100, how much profit do you make?

For a healthy financial situation:
- **Debt-to-Equity**: Should be manageable (not too high)
- **ROE**: Should be positive and ideally growing

PRADA shows both! ✅
