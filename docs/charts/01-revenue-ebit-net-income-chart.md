## Common Questions You Might Be Asked

1. **"Why are there three lines?"**
   - They show three different levels of profit: Revenue (top), Operating Profit (middle), Final Profit (bottom). Each line shows profit after subtracting more expenses.

2. **"Why is the Revenue line always on top?"**
   - Because revenue is the starting point - it's the total money from sales. Everything else (EBIT, Net Income) is revenue minus expenses, so they're always lower.

3. **"What does it mean if all lines go up?"**
   - Excellent! It means PRADA is growing in sales AND becoming more profitable. This is the best possible scenario.

4. **"What does the gap between lines mean?"**
   - The gap shows expenses:
   - **Revenue to EBIT gap**: Operating expenses (rent, salaries, marketing)
   - **EBIT to Net Income gap**: Interest, taxes, other expenses

5. **"Why is the EBIT line gold?"**
   - Gold is PRADA's brand color, and EBIT is a key metric. The color helps it stand out as important.

6. **"What if a line goes down?"**
   - That would be concerning! But PRADA's chart shows all lines going up, which is excellent.

7. **"How do I know if the growth is good?"**
   - Look at how steep the lines are:
   - **Steep upward slope** = Fast growth ✅
   - **Gentle upward slope** = Slow but steady growth
   - **Flat line** = No growth
   - **Downward slope** = Declining ❌

8. **"Can I compare PRADA to other companies using this chart?"**
   - Yes, but you'd need the same chart for the other company. The chart format makes comparison easy.

## Common Misinterpretations to Avoid

❌ **"The lines are close together, so expenses are low"**

✅ **Correct**: "The gaps between lines show expenses. As the lines grow and gaps get relatively smaller, PRADA is becoming more efficient."

❌ **"All lines should be the same height"**
- No! Revenue should always be highest, then EBIT, then Net Income. That's the correct order.

✅ **Correct**: "The lines should be in this order: Revenue (top), EBIT (middle), Net Income (bottom). This shows the profit 'waterfall'."
