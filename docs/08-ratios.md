## Common Questions You Might Be Asked

1. **"What is a Financial Ratio?"**
   - A ratio is a calculated number that compares two financial items. It helps you understand relationships and performance. Like "miles per gallon" for a car - it's a useful comparison metric.

2. **"What is Gross Margin %?"**
   - It's the percentage of revenue that becomes gross profit (after subtracting cost of goods sold). PRADA's 80.4% means for every €100 in sales, they make €80.40 in gross profit.

3. **"What is EBIT Margin %?"**
   - It's operating profit as a percentage of revenue. PRADA's 22.5% means for every €100 in sales, they make €22.50 in operating profit (before interest and taxes).

4. **"What is Net Margin %?"**
   - It's final profit as a percentage of revenue. PRADA's 14.2% means for every €100 in sales, they keep €14.20 as final profit (after all expenses and taxes).

5. **"What is Debt-to-Equity Ratio?"**
   - It shows how much debt PRADA has compared to equity. A lower ratio is generally better (less risk). PRADA's ratio is healthy, meaning they're not over-leveraged.

6. **"What is Return on Equity (ROE)?"**
   - It shows how well PRADA uses shareholders' money to generate profit. Higher ROE = better use of capital. PRADA's ROE improved, showing they're using money more efficiently.

7. **"Why are margins important?"**
   - Margins show profitability efficiency. Higher margins = more profit from each sale = better business performance. PRADA's improving margins show they're becoming more profitable.

8. **"What's a good margin?"**
   - It depends on the industry! For luxury fashion, PRADA's margins are excellent:
   - Gross Margin: 80%+ (excellent - luxury brands can charge premium prices)
   - EBIT Margin: 22.5% (very good)
   - Net Margin: 14.2% (strong)

9. **"How do I read the ratio charts?"**
   - Look at the trend lines:
   - **Going up** = improving (good for profit margins, ROE)
   - **Going down** = declining (good for debt-to-equity if decreasing)
   - **All PRADA's profit ratios going up** = excellent performance!

## Real-World Analogy

Think of ratios like health metrics:
- **Gross Margin**: Like your "take-home pay percentage" - how much of your salary you keep after basic expenses

- **ROE**: Like "return on investment" - if you invest €100, how much profit do you make?
- **Debt-to-Equity**: Like your "debt-to-income ratio" - how much debt vs. assets you have
